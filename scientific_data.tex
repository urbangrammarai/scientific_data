\begin{abstract}
% This is a manuscript template for Data Descriptor submissions to \emph{Scientific Data}
% (\href{http://www.nature.com/scientificdata}{http://www.nature.com/scientificdata}). The
% abstract must be no longer than 170 words, and should succinctly describe the study, the
% assay(s) performed, the resulting data, and the reuse potential, but should not make any
% claims regarding new scientific findings. No references are allowed in this section.

% intro
The spatial arrangement of the building blocks that make up cities matters  to
understand the rules directing their dynamics.
% one line summary
Our study outlines the development of the national open-source classification of space
according to its form and function into a single typology.
% input
We create a bespoke granular spatial unit, enclosed tessellation, and measure
characters capturing its form and function within a relevant spatial context.
% method
Using the two-level K-Means clustering of individual enclosed tessellation cells, we generate
classification of space for the whole of Great Britain.
% result
Contiguous enclosed tessellation cells belonging to the same class are merged
forming spatial signature geometries and their typology.
% findings
We identify 16 distinct types of spatial signatures stretching from a wild countryside,
through various kinds of suburbia to types denoting urban centres according to their
regional importance.
% use case
The open data product has the potential to serve as a boundary delineation for other
researchers interested in urban environment and policymakers looking for a unique
perspective on cities and their structure.

% main text – no abbreviations lists or tables should be included. Structure of the main
% text is provided below.

\section*{Background \& Summary}

%       (700 words maximum) An overview of the study design, the assay(s) performed, and the
%       created data, including any background information needed to put this study in the
%       context of previous work and the literature. The section should also briefly outline the
%       broader goals that motivated the creation of this dataset and the potential reuse value.
%       We also encourage authors to include a figure that provides a schematic overview of the
%       study and assay(s) design. The Background \& Summary should not include subheadings.
%       This section and the other main body sections of the manuscript should include citations
%       to the literature as needed.

\section*{Data Records}

% The Data Records section should be used to explain each data record associated with this
% work, including the repository where this information is stored, and to provide an
% overview of the data files and their formats. Each external data record should be cited
% numerically in the text of this section, for example \cite{Hao:gidmaps:2014}, and
% included in the main reference list as described below. A data citation should also be
% placed in the subsection of the Methods containing the data-collection or analytical
% procedure(s) used to derive the corresponding record. Providing a direct link to the
% dataset may also be helpful to readers
% (\hyperlink{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.853801}{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.853801}).

% Tables should be used to support the data records, and should clearly indicate the
% samples and subjects (study inputs), their provenance, and the experimental
% manipulations performed on each (please see 'Tables' below). They should also specify
% the data output resulting from each data-collection or analytical step, should these
% form part of the archived record.

\input{03_data.tex}

\section*{Technical Validation}

% This section presents any experiments or analyses that are needed to support the
% technical quality of the dataset. This section may be supported by figures and tables,
% as needed. This is a required section; authors must present information justifying the
% reliability of their data.

\input{04_validation.tex}


\section*{Usage Notes}

The released dataset is following the widespread standards for geographic data storage and
should not pose a challenge for researchers wanting to reuse it. However, due to the density of
signature geometry (resulting from the detailed ETCs), it may be needed to simplify the
geometry for a smoother interactive experience on machines with limited resources.

Replication of the analysis optimally requires at least a single computational node with
a large amount of RAM (100 GB+) due to the size of the input data and detail on which
signature characterization is computed. It is also recommended to revisit the state of
the development of related software packages, notably momepy, libpysal, tobler and
dask-geopandas as they may soon offer more efficient drop-in replacements
of the custom code used to produce this dataset.

\section*{Code availability}

The source code used to produce this dataset is openly available in a GitHub repository
at
\hyperlink{https://github.com/urbangrammarai/spatial\_signatures}{https://github.com/urbangrammarai/spatial\_signatures}
and in the form of a website on
\hyperlink{https://urbangrammarai.github.io}{https://urbangrammarai.github.io}.
Code is
organized in a series of Jupyter notebooks and have been executed within the darribas:gds\_env
Docker container, unless specified otherwise in the individual notebooks.

\bibliography{refs}

% \noindent LaTeX formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography
% records in your .bib file, which you can edit via the project menu. Use the cite command
% for an inline citation, e.g. \cite{Kaufman2020, Figueredo:2009dg, Babichev2002,
% behringer2014manipulating}. For data citations of datasets uploaded to e.g.
% \emph{figshare}, please use the \verb|howpublished| option in the bib entry to specify
% the platform and the link, as in the \verb|Hao:gidmaps:2014| example in the sample
% bibliography file. For journal articles, DOIs should be included for works in press that
% do not yet have volume or page numbers. For other journal articles, DOIs should be
% included uniformly for all articles or not at all. We recommend that you encode all DOIs
% in your bibtex database as full URLs, e.g. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-009-9068-2.

% and editors, or effusive comments. Grant or contribution numbers may be acknowledged.

\section*{Figures \& Tables}

xxxTODOxxx move figures and tables here

% Figures, tables, and their legends, should be included at the end of the document.
% Figures and tables can be referenced in \LaTeX{} using the ref command, e.g. Figure
% \ref{fig:stream} and Table \ref{tab:example}.

% Authors are encouraged to provide one or more tables that provide basic information on
% the main ‘inputs’ to the study (e.g. samples, participants, or information sources) and
% the main data outputs of the study. Tables in the manuscript should generally not be
% used to present primary data (i.e. measurements). Tables containing primary data should
% be submitted to an appropriate data repository.

% Tables may be provided within the \LaTeX{} document or as separate files (tab-delimited
% text or Excel files). Legends, where needed, should be included here. Generally, a Data
% Descriptor should have fewer than ten Tables, but more may be allowed when needed.
% Tables may be of any size, but only Tables which fit onto a single printed page will be
% included in the PDF version of the article (up to a maximum of three).

% Due to typesetting constraints, tables that do not fit onto a single A4 page cannot be
% included in the PDF version of the article and will be made available in the online
% version only. Any such tables must be labelled in the text as ‘Online-only’ tables and
% numbered separately from the main table list e.g. ‘Table 1, Table 2, Online-only Table
% 1’ etc.
