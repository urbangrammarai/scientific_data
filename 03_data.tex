The dataset stored in the repository contains a GeoPackage with a signature geometry
(OSGB36 / British National Grid (\texttt{EPSG:27700}) CRS) and related signature type,
plain-text pen portraits describing individual signature types, a series of CSV files
describing individual signatures and signature types, and a CSV files linking signature
types to the Output Area and Lower Super Output Area geometry. An online interactive map
of spatial signatures for the whole of Great Britain is available on the project website
