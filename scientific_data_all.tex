\begin{abstract}
The spatial arrangement of the building blocks that make up cities matters  to
understand the rules directing their dynamics. Our study outlines the development of the
national open-source classification of space according to its form and function into a
single typology. We create a bespoke granular spatial unit, the enclosed tessellation,
and measure characters capturing its form and function within a relevant spatial
context. Using K-Means clustering of individual enclosed tessellation cells, we generate
a classification of space for the whole of Great Britain. Contiguous enclosed
tessellation cells belonging to the same class are merged forming spatial signature
geometries and their typology. We identify 16 distinct types of spatial signatures
stretching from wild countryside, through various kinds of suburbia to types denoting
urban centres according to their regional importance. The open data product presented
here has the potential to serve as boundary delineation for other researchers interested
in urban environments and policymakers looking for a unique perspective on cities and
their structure.

\section*{Background \& summary}
How the building blocks that make up cities are spatially arranged is worth
quantifying and understanding.
By "building blocks", we mean both the activities and agents that inhabit
cities, as well as the (infra)structure that supports them. The
former can be conceptualised as \textit{urban function}, while the latter
falls under the study of \textit{urban form}.
Understanding urban form and function is important for two main reasons.
First, the combination of both \textit{encodes} rich information about the
history, character and evolution of cities.
For example, the shape and properties of the street network encode the technology of the
time (e.g., automobile); while the degree of mix in land uses can reflect
cultural values.
Second, the spatial pattern of urban form and function also acts as a
frame that \textit{influences} a variety of outcomes, from economic
productivity to socio-economic cohesion to environmental sustainability.
In this paper, we use the Spatial Signatures framework \cite{dab_mf_2021a, dab_mf_2021b},
which develops a ``characterisation of space based on form and function
designed to understand urban environments''\cite{dab_mf_2021a}.
Spatial signatures are theory-informed, data-driven computable classes that
describe the form and function of a consistent patch of geography.
Figure \ref{fig:workflow} presents an overview of the development of a spatial
signature classification.
We build a series of enclosures that we combine with building footprints
to further subdivide geographical space into what we call enclosed tessellation cells (ETCs). We then attach form and function
characters to each of these subdivisions, and use those to group them into
consistent and differentiated classes we call signatures.
Each phase is expanded in detail in the next section.
We introduce an open data product (ODP \cite{odp_paper21}) containing a classification of
spatial signatures for Great Britain (illustrated in a figure \ref{fig:map}). In doing so, we provide an
analysis-ready layer that brings together urban form and function consistently, in
detail, and at national scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
dataset capturing urban form and function published both with a degree of detail and scale as
ours.
Our results are based on the analysis of more than 14 million of ETCs, to
each of which we attach more than 300 characters capturing a wide range of
aspects relating to urban form and function.
We provide access to both granular geographical boundaries of the delineated spatial signatures
as well as measurements for each character at the signature level.
The ODP also includes a web map that allows exploration without any technical
requirement other than a web browser, and we have open sourced all the code,
including details on the computational backend.
The uniqueness of our ODP makes it challenging to set up a technical validation as a
comparison with existing datasets. Nevertheless, we relate our
signatures to a few well-established data products that capture each a subset
of the form and function dimensions we consider. Our results are encouraging
in that they show broad agreement in expected areas, but also highlight
aspects that can only be discovered when considering form and function in tandem.
The approach and outputs presented bring several benefits to a range of
stakeholders interested in cities.
This spatial signatures ODP provides insight generated from detailed,
comprehensive and computationally intensive data analysis and presents it in a
way that is easy to access, work with and integrate into larger projects.
Together with the importance of form and function discussed above, we
anticipate the output will be relevant to both academic researchers as well as
policymakers and practitioners.
As a framework, the spatial signatures provide a flexible yet
generalisable way to understand, characterise and quantify urban form and
function.
One way to understand our results is as an application to Great
Britain of a more general approach to quantitatively characterise the spatial dimension of cities.
As such, our conceptual approach can be applied in many more
local contexts and regions beyond Great Britain.
It is true that Great Britain currently represents an unusual case in that it
is specially ``data dense'', with a large variety of open data that may not be
readily available in other parts of the world. However, given form and
function reinforce each other, spatial signatures are designed to be robust to
variations in the specific data sources used, and two different
classifications do not need to be based on exactly the same data to be useful.
At the same time, we note that
the combination of volunteered geographic information (e.g., OpenStreetMap)
and technologies such as modern satellites and artificial intelligence are
filling many of these gaps very rapidly, and we anticipate near-future
developments that will make the implementation of classifications such as the
one presented here possible in almost any (urban) area of the planet.
In this sense, our ODP (data, code, and methodology) can be a useful illustration for researchers and practitioners who, even if not
specifically interested in the British use case, would like to implement a similar
approach on their own.
As illustration of potential applications, we provide two. The spatial
signatures may be used to delineate types of
(origin and destination) locations in mobility analysis, that could unveil patterns
of commuting or migration in situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. A second
application may focus directly on supporting policy on inequalities. For
example the spatial signatures can underpin analysis on equality of access
to services and amenities within the UKs Levelling Up
agenda\cite{luwp22}, using them to target
areas based on their signature type, since they will share key structural
components. It is important to note we do not expect signatures to focus on a single
aspect of urban environment as, for example, Local Climate Zones \cite{stewart2012local}
do with climate, but instead on a wider range of
uses due to their inclusion of both form and function and a data driven nature reflecting
the specific place rather than abstract conceptual classes.
In this respect, we hope the present paper serves not only to document our own
work but to inspire future efforts aimed at urban form and function.
\section*{Methods}
The method of identification of spatial signatures consists of three top-level steps.
First, we delineate a spatial unit of analysis that reflects the structure of
urban phenomena on a very granular level. Then we characterise each of them
according to form and function, capturing the nature of each unit and its spatial
context. Finally, we use cluster analysis to derive a typology of our spatial units
that, once combined into contiguous areas, forms a typology of spatial signatures.
\subsection*{Spatial unit}
The first major methodological decision relates to the definition of the
spatial unit. An ideal candidate needs to reflect space in a granular manner, and we argue
it should fulfil three conditions. First, it should be \textit{indivisible},
meaning that any subdivision would result in a unit that is incapable of
capturing the nature of urban form and function. Second, it needs to be
\textit{internally consistent} - it should always reflect only a single signature type.
Last, it should be geographically \textit{exhaustive}, covering the entirety of the study
area.
Spatial units used in literature can be split into three groups. One is using
administrative boundaries like city regions\cite{angel2020}, wards or census output areas\cite{alexiou2016}, that are
convenient to obtain and can be easily linked to auxiliary data. However,
those rarely reflect the morphological composition of urban space and, in some cases, may
even “obscure morphologic reality”\cite{taubenbock2019new}. At the same time, most of them
are divisible, and larger units are not always internally consistent. Another group is based on
arbitrary uniform grids linked either to spatial indexing methods like
H3\cite{brodsky2018h3} or Ordnance Survey
National Grid, or to ancillary data of remote sensing or other origins like a
WorldPop grid\cite{jochem2021tools}. Grids however cannot be considered internally
consistent as
they do not consider the underlying structure of the landscape.
Finally, urban morphology studies tend to use morphological elements as
street segments\cite{araldi2019}, blocks\cite{gil2012},
buildings\cite{hamaina2012a} or plots\cite{bobkova2019} as units of analysis.
Some of those
could be seen as indivisible and internally consistent, but since they are largely based
on built-up fabric, they are not exhaustive. For example, in areas without any building or
street, there
is no spatial unit to work with. Plots could be theoretically considered as exhaustive,
consistent and indivisible, but there is no accepted conceptual definition and unified
geometric representation\cite{kropf2018}.
We are, therefore, proposing an application of an alternative spatial unit called \textit{enclosed
tessellation cell} (ETC), defined as "the portion of space that results
from growing a morphological tessellation within an enclosure delineated by a series
of natural or built barriers identified from the literature on urban form, function and
perception"\cite{dab_mf_2021a}.
ETCs follow the morphological tradition in that it is
based on the physical elements of an environment but overcome the drawbacks of
conventionally used units. Its geometry is generated in the three steps illustrated in a
Figure \ref{fig:et_diagram}. First, a set of features representing physical barriers
subdividing space, in our case composed of the street network, railways, rivers and a
coastline, is combined, generating a layer of boundaries (\ref{fig:et_diagram} A).
These then partition space
into smaller enclosed geometries called \textit{enclosures} (\ref{fig:et_diagram} B),
which can be very granular
or very coarse depending on the geographic context. In dense city centres where a single
enclosure represents a single block is a high frequency of small enclosures. At the same time, in the
countryside, this approach leads to very few large enclosures as their delimiters are far away
from each other. Enclosures are then combined with building footprints (\ref{fig:et_diagram} B),
which act as
anchors in space and potentially subdivide enclosures into enclosed tessellation cells using the
morphological tessellation algorithm\cite{fleischmann2020} (\ref{fig:et_diagram} D),
a polygon-based adaptation of Voronoi
tessellation. The resulting geometries are indivisible as they contain, at most, a single
anchor building, internally consistent due to their granularity and link to morphological
elements composing urban fabric, and geographically exhaustive as they cover an entire area
limited by specified boundaries.
In our ODP for Great Britain, street networks are extracted from OS
Open Roads datasets\cite{openroads2020} representing simplified road centrelines
cleaned of underground road segments.
Railways are retrieved from OS OpenMap - Local\cite{openmap2020}
("RailwayTrack" layer) which captures surface railway tracks. Rivers are extracted from
OS OpenRivers\cite{openrivers2020} representing river network of GB as centrelines, and a coastline is
retrieved from OS Strategi®\cite{strategi2016}, capturing coastline as a continuous line
geometry. Building geometry is extracted, again, from OS OpenMap - Local ("Building"
layer) and represents generalised building footprint polygons. Note that the dataset
does not distinguish between individual buildings when they are adjacent (e.g. perimeter
block composed of multiple buildings is represented by a single polygon).
\subsection*{Characterisation of space}
Spatial signatures capture the character of the built and unbuilt environment
based on two components - form and function. Each of them is quantified at the level of
individual ETCs using methods appropriate for each specific dataset. While form
is described using urban morphometrics (i.e. quantitative analysis of urban
form)\cite{dibble2019origin}, function is a composite of a variety of data inputs. We outline each
component with a bit more detail below.
\subsubsection*{Form}
Morphometric characterisation of urban form is based on the numerical description
of four elements capturing the built environment - buildings, streets, ETCs, and
enclosures - and reflects their patterns based on six categories of
characters: dimensions, shapes, spatial
distribution, intensity, connectivity and diversity\cite{fleischmann2020a}. Each element is considered across
different scales, from the measurement of individual geometries, to relations of
neighbouring geometries, to a graph-based analysis of the street network. The combination of
elements, categories and scales results in a set of 59 individual morphometric
characters listed in the supplementary table \ref{tab:form}. The selection builds on the principles
outlined by \cite{dibble2019origin} and later explored by \cite{fleischmann2021}, both
following the rules derived by \cite{sneath1973numerical}. The gist is to include as
many characters present in literature as is feasible, while minimising potential
collinearity and limiting redundancy of information. That can be caused by capturing the same
phenomena, like a specific aspect of the shape of a building, using multiple characters. Note that
the characters that are statistically correlated but capture different concepts are kept as such
information reflects the nature of urban form and thus increases the robustness of the method.
However, measuring individual characters is not enough to understand the predominant
spatial patterns. For some types of urban environment, high heterogeneity is not
uncommon. This means that using, for example, areas of building footprints would, in most cases, result
in largely discontinuous clusters that do not capture the pattern within an area. Therefore, we represent each of the
morphometric characters using three summary variables reflecting statistical distributions
of measured data within a spatial context of each ETC. Context is defined as
tenth
order of contiguity computed across the mesh composed of contiguous ETCs as illustrated
in figure \ref{fig:context}. Furthermore, each
value is weighted by the inverse distance between so-called poles of inaccessibility
(defined as a centre of a maximum inscribed circle) of each ETC. Three proxy variables
then capture the first, the second and the third quartile of the resulting weighted
distribution. Such a characterisation can capture the contextual tendency of each
morphometric character and hence identify contiguous clusters in both homogenous and
heterogeneous urban tissues. These contextual values are then used as an input for
cluster analysis while the original non-contextualised versions are left out, making the
final form component composed of 177 contextual characters.
\subsubsection*{Function}
Characterisation of the function component uses a different approach. While data
describing urban form are not generally available in a processed format, forcing us to employ morphometric approaches, different aspects of function are often available as
open data products.
We guide the compilation of functional characters following three main
principles: first, we identify from the literature on urban function key areas
to be represented; second, we translate those abstract areas into measurable
features; and third, we select open data available in for Great Britain that
allows for the redistribution of derivative products.
With a list of function characters selected, the main goal of our characterisation of ETCs based on
function is to develop appropriate transfer methods to link data published as grids or
linked to administrative boundaries to ETCs.
In this work, we are using five different transfer methods: Areal interpolation,
Building-based dasymetric areal interpolation\cite{eli_knaap_2021_5047613} using building footprint area, Network-constrained accessibility,
Euclidean accessibility, and Zonal statistics. Areal interpolation is used when the
functional data covers the entirety of space in the
form of polygon geometry and when there is no assumption that the phenomena it captures
are linked directly to the human population, such as land cover data. When there is
an assumption of relation to the population, building-based dasymetric areal
interpolation is used instead. The main difference is that instead of ETC polygons,
building footprint polygons linked to individual ETCs are used as a target of
interpolation. That ensures that data like population estimates are linked to ETCs
proportionally to their ability to house population rather than by their area.
Network-constrained accessibility is used when the input data represents points of
interest like locations of supermarkets. Points are then snapped to the nearest node on
the street network and linked to the ETCs through the count of observations
accessible from the cell within 15 minutes of walk (1200m on the street network) and a distance to the nearest point. In
some cases, Euclidean (as-crow-flies) accessibility is measured instead to accommodate
for phenomena that are often outside the reach of a drivable network like water bodies.
Zonal statistics are used to transfer data originally stored in a raster
format to ETCs as the mean value of raster pixels intersecting each polygon
geometry. Finally, characters based on interpolation and zonal statistics are expressed
using their contextual versions following the method used for form characters to, again,
reflect the contextual pattern of measured values. As in the case of morphometric characters,
only contextual versions are then used in the cluster analysis. The selection of datasets and the chosen
transfer method are listed in the supplementary table \ref{tab:function}.
\subsection*{Cluster analysis}
When combined, contextual summaries of form and function characters (or characters
themselves when they are reflecting the context by definition) compose a dataset
describing each ETC by 328 variables (177 contextual characters representing 59 initial
characters for form and 151 for function composed of 144 contextual characters
representing 48 characters that do not capture context by design and 10
accessibility-based characters that do).
Assigning equal weight to each variable, we standardize them applying
Z-score normalization, and use them as input for K-Means cluster analysis.
Although collinearity is likely to be present between several of them, we do
not view this as a problem: we select each character not from a purely
statistical point of view (i.e., which ones will be more effective at
segmenting the dataset), but instead from a conceptual one. Each variable has
been identified by the literature on urban form and function as a relevant
aspect that contributes to collectively characterising these two more abstract
concepts. We thus see this situation as a way of adding robustness to the
measurement of more conceptual notions which are ultimately our aim.
We opt for K-Means because we consider it strikes a compromise in
the trade-off between performance and scalability. K-Means is widely used in the literature on
unsupervised learning, and in much of that concerning the clustering of
geographic entities\cite{webber2018predictive}.
To select the algorithm, we experimented with a random subset of our dataset,
comparing K-Means with alternatives such as Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMM) or Self-Organising Maps (SOM). We found results from the
latter two were not notably better in terms of cluster compactness and qualitative examination
of the geographic clusters, but were significantly slower in computation
runtime, posing serious challenges to be run at scale.
Although K-Means does not consider space explicitly, our approach incorporates
information about the geographic context of each observation through the
operation described above and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:context}. We
prefer this over a spatially-constrained algorithm (e.g.,
SKATER\cite{lage2001minimal}) that restricts the clustering only among spatially contiguous observations
because we are not interested in areas that are spatially contiguous unless
they are sufficiently similar to each other on the attribute space. Our
contextual approach is more similar to spatially-encouraged algorithms such as the
GeoSOM\cite{baccao2005self} or spatially-encouraged spectral clustering\cite{wolf2021spatially} that incorporate geographic proximity when
clustering but do not restrict. Our choice in this case was led by its
scalability over other such algorithms.
Nevertheless, we consider this a fruitful avenue for future research.
Due to the nature of the selected K-Means clustering, the step preceding the final
analysis is the selection of an optimal number of clusters. We use the
clustergram exploratory method\cite{schonlau2002clustergram}, reflecting the behaviour of different options, the relationship
between clustering solutions regarding the allocation of individual observations to
classes, and the separation between the clusters within each tested solution (figure \ref{fig:clustergram}).
Clustergram is further accompanied by measures of internal validation measures - the
Silhouette score diagram, Calinski-Harabasz index\cite{calinski1974} and Davies-Bouldin index\cite{davies1979cluster}. The optimal
number of classes is selected based on the interpretation of clustergram supported by
additional measures aiming at a balance between cluster separation and an appropriate
detail of resulting classification. We use mini batch K-Means with a batch size of 1,000,000
and 100 initialisations to create the clustergram and test number of clusters between 2 and
25. The results indicate 10 clusters as an optimal solution. The final clustering solution
is generated using mini batch K-Means with a batch size of 1,000,000 and 1,000 initialisations
to ensure the stability of the outcome.
The results of the clustering capture the first group of a national signature
classification composed of ten clusters. However, since the classified ETCs
cover the entirety of space, from vast
natural open spaces to dense city centres, it may result in only a few classes
representing urban areas. While that is caused by the variable heterogeneity of our
dataset in combination with K-Means clustering, the measured characters have the ability
to further distinguish classes of already identified clusters. As spatial signatures
are focused on the urban environment, we further subdivide those clusters covering
a substantial portion of urban areas using another iteration of K-Means clustering
(one class into nine and another into three clusters). Both subdivisions were created using
standard K-Means (single batch) using 1,000 initialisations.
The resulting classification then provides a classification capturing the typology of
spatial signatures with a detailed focus on urban development.
Finally, individual spatial signature geometries are generated as a combination of
adjacent ETCs belonging to the same signature class. To describe each geometry and
each signature type, we measure mean values of the original, non-contextualised
characters, and release it as additional descriptive tables. The resulting numerical
profile of each signature type is available as supplementary table \ref{tab:port}. Supplementary table \ref{tab:pens} contains pen portraits
derived from these numerical profiles.
\section*{Data records}
The data product \cite{fleischmannmartin2021Geographical} described in this article is available through the Consumer Data
Research Centre Open Data repository \cite{cdrc}
under the Open Government Licence v3.0 license and archived \cite{fleischmannmartin2021Geographical}.
The dataset stored in the repository contains a GeoPackage with a signature geometry
(OSGB36 / British National Grid (\texttt{EPSG:27700}) CRS) and related signature type,
plain-text pen portraits describing individual signature types, a series of CSV files
describing individual signatures and signature types, and a CSV files linking signature
types to the Output Area and Lower Super Output Area geometry. An online interactive map
of spatial signatures for the whole of Great Britain is available on the project website
(\hyperlink{https://urbangrammarai.xyz/great-britain}{https://urbangrammarai.xyz/great-britain}).
The underlying data used to create the ODP are available in a dedicated GitHub repository
available from (\hyperlink{https://github.com/urbangrammarai/signatures\_gb}{https://github.com/urbangrammarai/signatures\_gb}).
\section*{Technical validation}
\subsection*{Character importance}
The characters used in the cluster analysis have each different importance in distinguish between signature types.
Those characters which spatial distribution most closely matches the distribution of signatures
can be seen as more important that those that are seemingly random or mostly invariant (as some of the land cover classes are).
Unpacking the importance of individual characters from K-Means clustering cannot be done directly. However,
we provide indirect evidence from two different approaches. First, we can use the F-test to assess the significance of the relationship between characters and signature types by regressing each character on a set of indicator variables with our signature classes. If the variation in the character maps onto that between classes, the F-test will reject the null hypothesis and will be considered significant. In the second exercise, we
train a supervised model, in our case Random Forest, designed to predict individual
signature types from input data. The former unpacks whether all the characters play a role
in the delineation of clusters while the latter provides indication on feature importance - a relative measure of
strength of each character in distinguishing between the types. Out of 328 characters,
18 are invariant (the full list includes: 'Land cover [Airports] Q1, Land cover [Mineral extraction
sites] Q1, Land cover [Road and rail networks and associated land] Q1, Land cover [Water
bodies] Q1, Land cover [Inland marshes] Q1, Land cover [Dump sites] Q1, Land cover
[Water courses] Q2, Land cover [Burnt areas] Q2, Land cover [Water courses] Q1, Land
cover [Burnt areas] Q1, Land cover [Agro-forestry areas] Q3, Land cover [Coastal
lagoons] Q2, Land cover [Burnt areas] Q3, Land cover [Agro-forestry areas] Q1, Land
cover [Agro-forestry areas] Q2, Land cover [Dump sites] Q2, Land cover [Coastal lagoons]
Q1, Land cover [Coastal lagoons] Q3')
and five insignificant at the 5\% level (the full list includes: Land cover [Green urban areas] Q1, Land cover [Road and rail networks and associated land] Q2,
Land cover [Water bodies] Q2, Land cover [Transitional woodland-shrub] Q1, Land cover [Coniferous forest] Q1)
(all derived from land cover) according to the F-test results. The results of
the Random Forest-based feature importance approach are shown in
a table \ref{tab:imp}. As can be seen, form-based characters dominate the top 10 characters, but it is worth
noting that these top 10 characters together bear only 0.196 of the overall importance.
A similar exercise can be done on at the level of individual clusters, with a binary Random Forest model trained
to distinguish that particular class from the other. Resulting relative importance of top 10 characters for each signature type
is presented in a supplementary table \ref{tab:imp_cls}. While it is clear that form-based characters still dominate the prediction,
the more urban signature types are, the higher the importance of function seems to be. Complete tables
with all characters are available as online Tables 1 and 2.
\subsection*{Comparison}
Spatial signatures are unique as a classification method, limiting the potential
validation. Therefore, we rather present a comparison of signatures and ancillary datasets capturing
conceptually similar aspects of the environment. We compare the signatures with four of
such datasets, each focusing on a different classification perspective, but all related
to our classification to a degree when we can assume there will be a measurable level of
association between the two:
\begin{itemize}
    \item WorldPop settlement patterns of building footprints (2021)\cite{jochem2021tools}
    \item Classification of Multidimensional Open Data of Urban Morphology (MODUM) (2015)\cite{alexiou2016}
    \item Copernicus Urban Atlas (2018)\cite{eea2018}
    \item Local Climate Zones (2019)\cite{demuzere2019mapping}
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Comparison approach}
All datasets, spatial signatures and those selected for a comparison contain a
categorical classification of space linked to their unique geometry. The first
requirement to be able to compare data products is to transfer their
information to the same geometry. We take two approaches for this step,
depending on the dataset we are comparing the signatures with:
an interpolation of one set of polygon-based data to another (input to ETCs);
or the conversion of
spatial signatures to the raster representation matching an input raster,
which is computationally more efficient when one of the layers is already a raster. The second
step is a statistical comparison of two sets of classification labels, one representing
spatial signature typology and the other comparison classes. We use contingency tables
and Pearson's $\chi^{2}$ test to determine whether the frequencies of observed
(signature types) and expected (comparison types) labels significantly differ in one or
more categories. Furthermore, we use Cramér's $V$ statistics\cite{cramer2016mathematical} to assess the strength of
the association.
\subsection*{WorldPop settlement patterns of building footprints}
WorldPop settlement patterns of building footprints dataset aims to derive a typology of
morphological patterns based on a gridded approach with cells of
100x100m, and building footprints. Authors measure six morphometric characters
linked to the grid cells and use them as input for an unsupervised clustering
algorithm leading to a six-class typology.
As the classification is dependent on building footprints, grid cells that do
not contain any information on the building-based pattern are treated as missing in the
final data product. For the comparison, this \textit{missing}
category is treated as a single class. It is assumed that the top-level large scale
patterns detected by the WorldPop method and spatial signatures will provide similar
results. However, there will be differences caused by the inclusion of function in spatial
signatures, higher granularity of both initial spatial units and the resulting
classification (6 vs 19 classes).
Signature typology is rasterized and linked to the WorldPop grid. The resulting
contingency table is shown in Figure \ref{fig:crosstab_worldpop}. There is a significant relationship between
two typologies, $\chi^{2} (114, N = 22993921) = 13341832, p < .001$. The strength of
association measured as Cram\'{e}r's $V$ is $0.311$, indicating moderate association.
The contingency table shows that WorldPop classes tend to be linked to groups of
signature types of a similarly degree of urbanity. A WorldPop class 15 is "undefined" due
to the lack of building footprints in the area, therefore overlapping a large portion of
signatures.
The difference between classifications is likely driven by two main aspects - one is the different
number of classes. We can see that WorldPop classes tend to cluster within a limited number of
signature types and vice versa. The only exception is allocation of signature types into classes 4 and 6,
which seems to heavily overlap. That is possibly caused by the second aspect - inclusion of function. Both
classes 4 and 6 tend to be outside of city centres but still within urban areas. While it is
the footprint-based form that is driving the difference between them, signatures in the same
area are often distinguished by function and varies access to amenities and services.
\subsection*{Multidimensional open data urban morphology}
Multidimensional Open Data Urban Morphology (MODUM) classification describes a typology
of neighbourhoods derived from 18 indicators capturing built environment as streets,
railways or parks, linked to the Census Output Area geometry. The classification
identifies 8 types of neighbourhoods.
Compared to the WorldPop classification, MODUM takes into account more features of
the built environment than building footprints, which makes it conceptually closer to the
spatial signatures. However, it is still focusing predominantly on the form component,
although there are some indicators that would be classified as function within the
signatures framework (e.g. population). The MODUM method uses a different way of
capturing context compared to the signatures, which leads to some classes being
determined predominantly by a single character. For example, the \textit{Railway Buzz} type
forms a narrow strip around the railway network, which is an effect signatures avoid.
MODUM typology is available only for England and Wales. Therefore, the comparison takes
into account only ETCs covering the same area. The classification is linked to the
ETC geometry is based on the proportion (the type covering the largest portion of ETC is
assigned). The resulting contingency table is shown in Figure \ref{fig:crosstab_modum}. There is a
significant relationship between two typologies, $\chi^{2} (152, N = 13067584) =
13938867, p < .001$. The strength of association measured as Cramér's $V$ is $0.300$,
indicating moderate association of very similar levels we have seen above. The
contingency table indicates similar relationships, where a single MODUM class overlaps a
group of signature types. However, the groups tend to be well defined and formed based
on the similarity of types. Signature types are minimally present in MODUM classes driven
by a single character (\textit{Railway Buzz}, \textit{Waterside Settings},
\textit{High Street and Promenades}), suggesting the more balanced weight of characters.
\subsection*{Copernicus urban atlas}
Copernicus Urban Atlas is the least similar of the comparison datasets. It is a
high-resolution land use classification of functional urban areas derived primarily from
Earth Observation data enriched by other reference data as OpenStreetMap or topographic
maps. Its smallest spatial unit in urban areas is 0.25 ha and 1 ha in rural areas,
defined primarily by physical barriers. It identifies
27 predefined classes using the supervised method.
The majority of urban areas is classified as urban fabric further distinguished based on
continuity and density resulting in six classes of the urban fabric. The classification does
not consider the type of the pattern or any other aspect. Furthermore, it does not take
into account what signatures call \textit{context} as each spatial unit is
classified independently, which in some cases leads to the high heterogeneity of
classification within a small portion of land. Signatures take a different approach.
Consequently, it is expected that the similarity between the two will be limited.
Urban Atlas is available only for functional urban areas (FUA), leaving rural areas
unclassified. Comparison then applies to FUAs only. The classification is linked to the
ETC geometry based on the proportion (the type covering the largest portion of ETC is
assigned). The resulting contingency table is shown in Figure \ref{fig:crosstab_ua}. There is a
significant relationship between two typologies, $\chi^{2} (450, N = 8396642) = 5229900,
p < .001$. The strength of association measured as Cramér's $V$ is $0.186$, indicating
a weak association. The contingency table shows the difference in the aim of spatial
signatures and that of Urban Atlas with a majority of signatures being linked to a few
of Urban Atlas classes. Within relevant classes, we see a tendency of signature types to
cluster within Urban Atlas classes based on the level of urbanity, albeit not as strong
as in the previous two cases.
The main reason behind such a large difference are the aims of both classifications. While
the Copernicus Urban Atlas attempts to capture land cover, resulting in a large number
of non-urban classes, spatial signatures are aimed at urban environment with 13 out of 16
classes covering primarily urbanised areas.
\subsection*{Local climate zones}
Local climate zones (LCZ) are conceptual classes originally designed to support study of urban
climate as temperature. It consists of 17 classes of which 10 can be classified as urban
and 7 and natural ones. In the context of Great Britain, the dataset used in this study
does not contain 2 of them, \textit{Lightweight low-rise} and \textit{Compact highrise}
as they are not present in the British landscape. The datasets produced by
\cite{demuzere2019mapping} released LCZs in a 100 meters grid based on the 2016 data. As
the LCZs are remotely sensed in this case, authors report overall average accuracy of 80 \%
As a conceptual classification aimed to cover all possible types of primarily urban climate zones globally,
LZCs may not be optimal when looking into a single country with specific history of urban
development. This is further indicated by classes that are missing. It is therefore likely
that large parts of British cities will fall into only a few of LCZ classes, while being represented
by a much larger number of signature types.
Signature typology is rasterized and linked to the LCZ grid.
The resulting contingency table is shown in Figure \ref{fig:crosstab_lcz}. There is a
significant relationship between two typologies, $\chi^{2} (225, N = 16203338) = 18467242,
p < .001$. The strength of association measured as Cramér's $V$ is $0.276$, indicating
a modest to weak association, close to values we have seen in first two cases. As expected,
urban signature types are clustered primarily within \textit{Compact midrise} and
\textit{Open lowrise} LCZs, while non-urban signatures mostly fall into the \textit{Low plants} LCZ.
The difference between signatures and LCZs can be accounted to two aspects. One, as we have seen
before is the inclusion of function in spatial signatures, differentiating e.g. LCZ's \textit{Open lowrise} into
many signature types. The other is data-driven nature of signatures compared to conceptual LCZs,
where differences in signature types are below the resolution capability of simple matrix composed of
density and compactness levels. On the other, it is encouraging to see that most of signature types
fall predominantly in a single LCZ class, suggesting that while both classifications are built differently,
they are able to capture similar large-scale patterns in cities.
\subsection*{Summary}
None of the comparisons shows more than a moderate association, but since none of the
comparison datasets is aiming to capture the same conceptualization of space as spatial
signatures do, such a result is expected. The moderate association with both WorldPop
settlements patterns and MODUM is reassuring as both are conceptually closer to
signatures than the Urban Atlas (especially in their unsupervised design). Urban Atlas,
though very different in its aims and methods, still shows a measurable association,
which we interpret as sign that the key structural aspects forming cities are captured by both. The
comparison exercise suggests that general patterns forming cities are shared among
signatures and existing typologies. Signature types tend to form groups when we look at
their relation to comparison classes and it is not uncommon that a single signature type
is present in multiple groups linked to different classes. However, all these groups
tend to be formed based on the similarity and illustrate the granularity of the
presented classification compared to existing datasets, allowing us to distinguish, for
example, five types of signature types forming town and city centres.
\section*{Usage notes}
The released data product follows widespread standards for geographic data storage and
should be easy to integrate with other data and methods by researchers wanting to reuse it. However, due to the density of
signature geometry (resulting from the detailed ETCs), it may be needed to simplify the
geometry for a smoother interactive experience on machines with limited resources.
Replication of the analysis optimally requires at least a single computational node with
a large amount of RAM (+100GB) due to the size of the input data and detail on which
signature characterisation is computed. It is also recommended revisiting the state of
the development of related software packages, notably
\texttt{momepy}\cite{fleischmann_2019}, \texttt{libpysal}\cite{rey2021pysal},
\texttt{tobler}\cite{eli_knaap_2021_5047613} and
\texttt{dask-geopandas} as they may soon offer more efficient drop-in replacements
of the custom code used to produce this dataset.

    Wild countryside                     &                                                                                       In “Wild countryside”, human influence is the least intensive. This signature covers large open spaces in the countryside where no urbanisation happens apart from occasional roads, cottages, and pastures. You can find it across the Scottish Highlands, numerous national parks such as Lake District, or in the majority of Wales. \\
    Countryside agriculture              &                                                                                                                                                                               “Countryside agriculture” features much of the English countryside and displays a high degree of agriculture including both fields and pastures. There are a few buildings scattered across the area but, for the most part, it is green space. \\
    Urban buffer                         &                                                                                             “Urban buffer” can be characterised as a green belt around cities. This signature includes mostly agricultural land in the immediate adjacency of towns and cities, often including edge development. It still feels more like countryside than urban, but these signatures are much smaller compared to other countryside types. \\
    Open sprawl                          &                                                                                                                           “Open sprawl” represents the transition between countryside and urbanised land. It is located in the outskirts of cities or around smaller towns and is typically made up of large open space areas intertwined with different kinds of human development, from highways to smaller neighbourhoods. \\
    Disconnected suburbia                &                                                                                                                                           “Disconnected suburbia” includes residential developments in the outskirts of cities or even towns and villages with convoluted, disconnected street networks, low built-up and population densities, and lack of jobs and services. This signature type is entirely car-dependent. \\
    Accessible suburbia                  &                                        “Accessible suburbia” covers residential development on the urban periphery with a relatively legible and connected street network, albeit less so than other more urban signature types. Areas in this signature feature low density, both in terms of population and built-up area, lack of jobs and services. For these reasons, “accessible suburbia” largely acts as dormitories. \\
    Warehouse/Park land                  &                                “Warehouse/Park land” covers predominantly industrial areas and other work-related developments made of box-like buildings with large footprints. It contains many jobs of manual nature such as manufacturing or construction, and very little population live here compared to the rest of urban areas. Occasionally this type also covers areas of parks with large scale green open areas. \\
    Gridded residential quarters         &                                                                                  “Gridded residential quarters” are areas with street networks forming a well-connected grid-like (high density of 4-way intersections) pattern, resulting in places with smaller blocks and higher granularity. This signature is mostly residential but includes some services and jobs, and it tends to be located away from city centres. \\
    Connected residential neighbourhoods &                                                                     “Connected residential neighbourhoods” are relatively dense urban areas, both in terms of population and built-up area, that tend to be formed around well-connected street networks. They have access to services and some jobs but may be further away from city centres leading to higher dependency on cars and public transport for their residents. \\
    Dense residential neighbourhoods     &                                                                                                                                           A “dense residential neighbourhood” is an abundant signature often covering large parts of cities outside of their centres. It has primarily residential purpose and high population density, varied street network patterns, and some services and jobs but not in high intensity. \\
    Dense urban neighbourhoods           &                                                                                                                            “Dense urban neighbourhoods” are areas of inner-city with high population and built-up density of a predominantly residential nature but with direct access to jobs and services. This signature type tends to be relatively walkable and, in the case of some towns, may even form their centres. \\
    Local urbanity                       &                                                                “Local urbanity” reflects town centres, outer parts of city centres or even district centres. In all cases, this signature is very much urban in essence, combining high population and built-up density, access to amenities and jobs. Yet, it is on the lower end of the hierarchy of signature types denoting urban centres with only a local significance. \\
    Regional urbanity                    &                                                             “Regional urbanity” captures centres of mid-size cities with regional importance such as Liverpool, Plymouth or Newcastle upon Tyne. It is often encircled by “Local urbanity” signatures and can form outer rings of city centres in large cities. It features high population density, as well as a high number of jobs and amenities within walkable distance. \\
    Metropolitan urbanity                &                                                                                    Signature type “Metropolitan urbanity” captures the centre of the largest cities in Great Britain such as Glasgow, Birmingham or Manchester. It is characterised by a very high number of jobs in the area, high built-up density and often high population density. This type serves as the core centre of the entire metropolitan areas. \\
    Concentrated urbanity                &  Concentrated urbanity” is a signature type found in the city centre of London and nowhere else in Great Britain. It reflects the uniqueness of London in the British context with an extremely high number of jobs and amenities located nearby, as well as high built-up and population densities. Buildings in this signature are large and tightly packed, forming complex shapes with courtyards and little green space. \\
    Hyper concentrated urbanity          &     The epitome of urbanity in the British context. “Hyper concentrated urbanity” is a signature type present only in the centre of London, around the Soho district, and covering Oxford and Regent streets. This signature is the result of centuries of urban primacy, with a multitude of historical layers interwoven, very high built-up and population density, and extreme abundance of amenities, services and jobs. \\
